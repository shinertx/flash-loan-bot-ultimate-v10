# Flash Loan Bot Ultimate (v10)

This repository implements a fully autonomous, AI‑driven flash loan bot for MEV arbitrage and liquidation.
Key features include:
- Flash loan arbitrage & liquidations via Aave and other protocols.
- Enhanced MEV logic with mempool analysis, bundle simulation, and competition-aware bidding.
- AI‑driven opportunity identification and dynamic risk management.
- Cross‑chain bridging (placeholder for future expansion).
- Robust error handling and monitoring.

**Warning:** This code is extremely ambitious and high‑risk. It contains placeholders and stub functions that must be replaced with real logic, thoroughly tested, and audited before live deployment.
